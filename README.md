# express-mongo-resource: coded by [Drew Stock] (https://github.com/DrewStock)
==================================================
This app launches a local HTTP server which is backed by a persistent data store. The server responds to GET, POST, PUT and DELETE requests for resources '/teams' and '/players', with the domain being my fantasy football league. :football:

...with the bonus of being powered by Express! :bullettrain_side:

...and Mongo! :floppy_disk:

The following are command line instructions for using the app.

* After cloning the repo:
    * type 'npm install'
* To launch the app and run tests:
    * type 'npm run test:watch'
* To launch the app:
    * type 'node server.js'
    * this creates a local HTTP server, which will be listening on port 5000
* Overview of functionality:
    * GET request to '/teams' or '/players', where resources are stored - server writes response text, a list of resources
    * GET request for '/teams/:id' or '/players/:id' - server writes response text, which is the contents of the resource
    * POST request for '/teams' or '/players' - server writes response text and creates a new resource, whose contents are the parsed body of the request
    * PUT request for resource at '/teams/:id' or '/players/:id' - server writes response text and creates a new resource (if not already existing) or updates an existing resource. The updated contents of the resource are the parsed body of the request
    * DELETE request to '/teams' or '/players' - server writes response text and deletes resource
